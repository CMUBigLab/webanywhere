Procedures to add new locale:
1. Find the proper symbol for your locale. "de" is for German for example. We may have more than one locale in a language. For example, we use zh_CN for simplified Chinese.
2. Change working directory to root of WA source code.
3. Add new directories. Take German for example: `mkdir -p locale/de/LC_MESSAGES`
4. Create an empty locale file. `touch locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/WebAnywhere.po`
5. Update locale template with `perl update_locale.pl`. Texts need to translage will be added to locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/WebAnywhere.po
6. Edit locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/WebAnywhere.po to translate the texts.
7. Run `perl update_locale.pl` to update *.php and *.js under locale directory.
8. Change the locale you want to use in config.php. Add one line like this:
   $fixed_locale = 'de';

Procedures to update existing locale:
1. Wrap new string in PHP/JS files with wa_gettext('new text')
2. Change working directory to root of WA source code and run `perl update_locale.pl`. All files under locale directory will be updated. A new entry for 'new text' will be added to *.po files.
3. Edit *.po files to translate 'new text'.
4. Redo step 2. *.php and *.js files will be updated according to updated *.po files.

How to change locale at runtime:
If $fixed_local is not specified in config.php, we can chage locale at runtime with something like "http://<WA-host>/index.php?locale=de"

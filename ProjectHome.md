[WebAnywhere](http://webinsight.cs.washington.edu/projects/webanywhere/) provides access to the web from any machine with a modern web browser and some way to play audio.  It is useful for web developers who would like to check their pages for accessibility and for blind web users using a computer where no other screen reader is available.

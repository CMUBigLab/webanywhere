#summary Information for developers that want to include or reference WebAnywhere from their site.

= Introduction =

This page is to introduce developers of other sites to the features of WebAnywhere that might be useful to them.


= FAQ =

== How do I get WebAnywhere to start at a particular page? ==

Set the starting_url argument.  For example, the following would redirect to Google.

http://webanywhere.cs.washington.edu/wa.php?starting_url=http://www.google.com/

We can also change following line in config.php
{{{
$default_content_url = 'http://webanywhere.cs.washington.edu/content.php';
}}}

== Why can't I access localhost? ==

There is a PHP proxy. We can comment out following code in wp/wawp.php to work around it:
{{{
show_report(array('which' => 'index', 'category' => 'error', 'group' => 'url', 'type' => 'external', 'error' => 1));
}}}

Since the proxy only block localhost and 127.0.0.1. A better solution is to add "127.0.0.1 your_local_domain" to /etc/hosts. Then access WA with your_local_domain.

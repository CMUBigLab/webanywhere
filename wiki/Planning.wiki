#summary Milestones, timeline, and other planning for upcoming "releases."

= Goals for Beta "release" =

We want to fix the following functions/issues to be released and to consider the project in beta.

  * In-page links should be working (currently works in everything except IE6)
  * Highlight chunks of text as read (working for most chunks, but work on smaller chunks in some instances?)
  * Handle frames and iframes
  * Ensure "find" is working
  * Magnified view (Jeff checked this in. Test that it works across platforms)
  * If something is hidden, don't read it aloud.

When testing WebAnywhere, use the following set of sites/applications:

  * google
  * gmail
  * university of washington
  * facebook
  * bookshare
  * blackboard/moodle
  * others?

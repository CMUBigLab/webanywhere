#summary Milestones, timeline, and other planning for upcoming "releases."

= Goals for Beta "release" =

After the following functions/issues are fixed, we will consider the project to be in beta.

  * In-page links should be working (currently works in everything except IE6)
    * Running into issues with in-page links and the proxy (?) on [http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/24/obama.news.conference/index.html cnn (example)].
  * Highlight chunks of text as read (working for most chunks, but work on smaller chunks in some instances?)
  * Handle frames and iframes
    * [http://www.martinish.com/folio/linkFrame/?url=www.schoolonthegreen.com&return=/folio/web frame example]
    * [http://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/iframes/ iframe examples]
    * [http://sp1ral.com/tests/iframe4.html iframe test page]
    * Text content of an iframe, e.g., {{{<iframe ...>text content</iframe>}}} causes an error for the spotlighter becaues it is not visible yet it tries to bring it into focus. Crashes.
  * Ensure "find" is working
  * Magnified view (Jeff checked this in. Test that it works across platforms)
  * If something is hidden, don't read it aloud.
  * Style of the "interface" - keep things together (bunched) and readable--all text in highlight. javascript->css.

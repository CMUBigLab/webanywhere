=Deploy Web Server=
==Installing Apache Webserver==

  # Download & Install Apache Webserver (also called Apache http server  
    * [http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi]
  # Install PHP and make sure it is applied to the Webserver
    * [http://www.php.net/downloads.php]
    * [http://www.expertsrt.com/tutorials/Matt/install-apache.html]

==Installing PHP==

  # Required modules:
    * OpenSSL
    * PDO
    * PSQLite

==Config Apache for Perl==
*This is only needed if you want to deploy Festival TTS server on Linux*
Add following code to apache.conf
{{{
Alias /perl/ /path/to/perl_scripts/
PerlModule ModPerl::Registry

<Location "/perl/">
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler ModPerl::Registry
Options +ExecCGI
PerlOptions +ParseHeaders
</Location> 
}}}

=Deploy Festival TTS Server=
*This is not a necessary step* to setup WebAnywhere because we could use following TTS server
http://webinsight.cs.washington.edu/cgi-bin/getsound.pl?text=hello
And this is only applicable for *Linux* now.

==Install Festival==
Use following command if you are using Debian based Linux:
{{{
sudo apt-get install festival
}}}

==Launch Festival Server==
{{{
festival --server
}}}

==Install Perl module Speech::Festival==
{{{
cpan -i Speech::Festival
}}}
The module is install in xxx/Speech/Speech/Festival.pm. It's a bug. You need to move folders tree as xxx/Speech/Festival.pm.

==Config getsound.pl==
The original version of getsound.pl locates at tts/festival/. We should copy it to the right path, /var/www/perl/ for example.

getsound.pl need lame and sox application. Make a symbol link to them under the path of getsound.pl.

Change following line to add our own TTS server:
{{{
my @servers = ('emil.cs.washington.edu', 'brangane.cs.washington.edu');
}}}

==Config config.php==
We may need to change following lines. Please make sure web server has written permission on the directory of webanywhere-accesses.sdb.
{{{
$sound_url_base = 'http://localhost/perl/getsound.pl?text=$text$&cache=1&mtts=1';
...
$sql_lite_filename = "C:/webanywhere-accesses.sdb";
}}}

=Deploy Webanywhere=

==Downloading the Code==
  # Install svn on the computer and checkout the code from this site.
    * TortoiseSVN is recommended for windows machines

==Setting Up Webanywhere in Apache==

  # Move the downloaded WebAnywhere code into the ?? folder where Apache gets the information to host.
  # Adjust the config.php file with the following adjustments: ... 
    * Change path of accesses database file: $sql_lite_filename = "C:/webanywhere-accesses.sdb";
  # Directing your internet browser to: ??? should now go the WebAnywhere hosted on your computer.

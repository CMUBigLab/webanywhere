=Deploy Web Server=
==Installing Apache Webserver==

  # Download & Install Apache Webserver (also called Apache http server  
    * [http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi]
    * [http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/04/07/how-to-install-apache-on-windows/ How to Install Apache Web Server on Windows]
  # Install PHP and make sure it is applied to the Webserver
    * [http://www.php.net/downloads.php]
    * Note: If using Windows, be sure to download the VC6 thread safe version. [http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/07/07/install-php53-windows/# How to Install PHP 5.3 on Windows]

==Installing PHP==

Required modules:
  * OpenSSL
  * PDO
  * SQLite 3

*Note: This no longer seems to be the case.* For windows PHP installer, SQLite 2 is the default. To install SQLite 3, You may need to do following:
  # download php_pdo_sqlite.dll to PHP/ext/
  # edit php.ini. change "extension=php_sqlite.dll" to "extension=php_pdo_sqlite.dll"
  # restart Apache

20100120--When installing on a Windows 7 machine Apache complained about not finding ntwdblib.dll which is needed by MySQL so I uncommented MySQL and MSQL from the PHP extensions set up.

==Configure Apache for Perl==
*This is only needed if you want to deploy Festival TTS server on Linux*

Install following modules:
 * libapache2-mod-perl2
 * libapache2-mod-musicindex

Add following code to apache.conf 
{{{
Alias /perl/ /path/to/perl_scripts/
PerlModule ModPerl::Registry

<Location "/perl/">
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler ModPerl::Registry
Options +ExecCGI
PerlOptions +ParseHeaders
</Location> 
}}}

=Deploy Festival TTS Server (optional)=
*It is not a must step* to setup WebAnywhere because we could use following TTS server
http://webinsight.cs.washington.edu/cgi-bin/getsound.pl?text=hello
And this is only applicable for *Linux* now.

==Install Festival==
Use following command if you are using Debian based Linux:
{{{
sudo apt-get install festival
}}}

==Launch Festival Server==
{{{
festival --server
}}}

You can also setup festival to run in the background with a command like this:
{{{
nohup festival --server > /dev/null 2> /dev/null < /dev/null &
}}}

==Install Perl module Speech::Festival==
{{{
cpan -i Speech::Festival
}}}
The module is install in xxx/Speech/Speech/Festival.pm. It's a bug. We need to move folders tree as xxx/Speech/Festival.pm. Also, we need to comment out one print statement.

{{{
sub DESTROY
{
    my ($self) = @_;

#    print "disconnect\n";
    disconnect $self;
}
}}}

==Configure getsound.pl==
The original version of getsound.pl locates at tts/festival/. We should copy it to the right path, /var/www/perl/ for example.

getsound.pl need lame and sox application. Make a symbol link to them under the path of getsound.pl.

Change following line to add our own TTS server:
{{{
my @servers = ('emil.cs.washington.edu', 'brangane.cs.washington.edu');
}}}

For example, if you have festival running on the same machine as the web server, then the following would be correct:

{{{
my @servers = ('localhost');
}}}

The festival server will by default accept connections to localhost.  If you want to add an additional TTS server, you'll need to edit the festival.scm file to allow connections from other computers in your domain.  For instance, at the University of Washington, I have the following, which enables connections from either localhost or computers whose hostname ends in cs.washington.edu:

{{{
(defvar server_access_list '(localhost "[^\\.\\\\]+\\.cs\\.washington\\.edu")
}}}

==Configure config.php==
We may need to change following lines. Please make sure web server has writing permission on the directory of webanywhere-accesses.sdb.
{{{
$sound_url_base = 'http://localhost/perl/getsound.pl?text=$text$&cache=1&mtts=1';
...
$sql_lite_filename = "C:/webanywhere-accesses.sdb";
}}}

=Deploy eSpeak TTS server (optional)=
eSpeak can speak many languages. And it's easy to deploy.

==Install eSpeak==
Please refer to http://espeak.sf.net
We don't need to launch a eSpeak server like Festival. We just need to make sure command `espeak` can be run.

==Configure getsound.pl==
We need to copy tts/espeak/getsound.pl to some path. This path is hard code in the script. So we need to change following line:
{{{
my $base_dir = '/home/hgneng/www-perl';
}}}

In getsound.pl of espeak, we add a "lang" variable to specify voice in espeak.

==Configure config.php==
Like Festival, we need to set following line: (espeak.pl is a copy of getsound.pl)
{{{

$sound_url_base = 'http://localhost/perl/espeak.pl?text=$text$&lang=cantonese';

}}}

=Deploy Ekho TTS server (optional)=
Ekho is a Chinese(Cantonese/Mandarin) TTS engine. It can also speak English through Festival.

==Install Ekho==
Please refer to http://www.eguidedog.net/ekho.php
The TTS server function works since verion 2.1 for Linux.

==Launch Ekho TTS server==
{{{
ekho --server -v Mandarin
}}}

To test whether Ekho server works:
{{{
ekho --request "123" -o output.mp3
}}}

A file output.mp3 should be generated.

==Configure ekho_agent.pl==
We need to copy tts/ekho/ekho_agent.pl to some path. This path is hard code in the script. So we need to change following line:
{{{
my $base_dir = '/var/www/cache/';
}}}

==Configure config.php==
Like Festival, we need to set following line:
{{{
$sound_url_base = 'http://localhost/perl/ekho_agent.pl?text=$text$&cache=1&mtts=1';
}}}

=Deploy Webanywhere=

==Downloading the Code==
  # Install svn on the computer and checkout the code from this site.
    * TortoiseSVN is recommended for windows machines

==Setting Up Webanywhere in Apache==

  # Move the downloaded WebAnywhere code into the htdocs folder within Apache.
  # Change the name of the WebAnywhere folder from "webanywhere" to "wa"
  # Adjust the config.php file with the following adjustments: ... 
    * Change path of accesses database file: $sql_lite_filename = "C:/webanywhere-accesses.sdb";
  # Directing your internet browser to http://localhost/wa/ should open the WebAnywhere hosted on your computer.
